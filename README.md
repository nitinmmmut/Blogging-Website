# Blogging-Website
Html css javascript



Task:
Develop a simple blogging website with a user interface (UI) as shown in the Figma link. The website should allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts.

Figma Link: https://www.figma.com/file/0XTN5vVszisgjoj9fXw3at/Blogging-Website?node-id=0%3A1&t=ffykZJydX7vZyeqz-1

Requirements:
The website should have a static header with a "Create a Blog" button. By default, the page should not show any blog posts.


A modal should appear when a user clicks on the "Create a Blog" button. The modal should contain a form allowing users to input their blog post's title and description. The title input should be type text, while the description should be a textbox. The modal should include an "X" button to allow the user to close it.


After the user saves/publishes their blog post, it should appear on the main page with the UI shown in the Figma link.


Users should be able to edit or delete their blog posts. If a user clicks the delete button, the selected blog post should be removed from the page. If a user clicks the edit button, a modal should appear with the title and description already filled out, allowing the user to edit the post.


Allow the user to view their search history and click on previous search queries to view the book data again.


The website should have a responsive UI, and the modals should work properly on all screen sizes.


The website should be deployed and accessible online.
